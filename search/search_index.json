This site presents a structured overview of all tasks, experiments, tools, and learnings gained throughout my internship, with a strong focus on Docker, virtual machines, networking, performance testing, and security tools. \ud83c\udfaf Project Objective The core aim of this internship is to evaluate the performance , flexibility , and efficiency of using Docker containers compared to traditional virtual machines . The focus is on: How fast and lightweight containers are for lab setups Resource consumption of VMs vs Docker How containers affect workflow, scalability, and repeatability Testing communication, network behavior, and performance \ud83d\udc33 Why Docker? Containers like Docker provide several benefits over VMs, especially in lab environments: \u2705 Lightweight - No full OS per container \u2705 Fast startup - Launch in seconds \u2705 Low resource usage - Less RAM and disk used \u2705 Portable & reproducible - Share labs as Docker images \u2705 Easier networking - Simulate networks using virtual bridges \u2705 Better for automation - Great with CI/CD or scripting \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f When VMs Might Be Better While Docker shines for many scenarios, VMs are still useful when: You need full OS access (e.g., GUI or kernel testing) Tools require real system-level access The lab needs different kernel versions \ud83d\udcc2 Documentation Structure Navigate through the sections using the sidebar.
