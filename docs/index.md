# Internship Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of my internship project. This site presents a structured overview of all tasks, experiments, tools, and learnings gained throughout my internship, with a strong focus on Docker, virtual machines, networking, performance testing, and security tools.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The core aim of this internship is to evaluate the **performance**, **flexibility**, and **efficiency** of using **Docker containers** compared to traditional **virtual machines**. The focus is on:

- How fast and lightweight containers are for lab setups
- Resource consumption of VMs vs Docker
- How containers affect workflow, scalability, and repeatability
- Testing communication, network behavior, and performance

---

## 🐳 Why Docker?

Containers like Docker provide several benefits over VMs, especially in lab environments:

✅ **Lightweight** - No full OS per container  
✅ **Fast startup** - Launch in seconds  
✅ **Low resource usage** - Less RAM and disk used  
✅ **Portable & reproducible** - Share labs as Docker images  
✅ **Easier networking** - Simulate networks using virtual bridges  
✅ **Better for automation** - Great with CI/CD or scripting

## 🖥️ When VMs Might Be Better

While Docker shines for many scenarios, VMs are still useful when:

- You need full OS access (e.g., GUI or kernel testing)
- Tools require real system-level access
- The lab needs different kernel versions
