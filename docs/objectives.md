# Internship Objectives

This internship focuses on evaluating the use of Docker containers as an alternative to virtual machines (VMs) for cybersecurity and networking labs. The objectives below outline the key technical goals and skills I aim to achieve during this project.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Understand Docker and Virtual Machine Architecture
- Compare how Docker and VMs operate at the system level.
- Identify benefits and trade-offs in terms of performance, resource use, and setup time.

### 2. Evaluate Docker as a Replacement for VMs in Teaching Labs
- Assess if Docker can provide an equivalent or better experience for students.
- Identify scenarios where Docker is more effective or where VMs are still necessary.

### 3. Perform Network Configuration and Communication Testing
- Use `ping`, `curl`, and `iperf3` to test connectivity and latency.
- Create and test Docker custom bridge networks (e.g., `labnet`).

### 4. Measure and Compare Resource Consumption
- Use tools like `htop`, `docker stats`, and Windows Task Manager.
- Compare CPU, memory, and disk usage between containers and VMs.

### 5. Analyze the Impact of Tools on Docker Image Size
- Install different tools inside containers (e.g., `curl`, `nmap`, `iperf3`) and measure image growth.
- Discuss implications for distribution, storage, and startup speed.

### 6. Test and Document Container Security
- Use tools like **Trivy** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- Understand the security risks of pulling public base images.
